Part of a lightweight Parent Portal, implemented by ASP. Core MVC 2.1
This blog includes only some parts of a parent portal. These are 'parent' and 'student' models and controllers and some startup files. 
Also, it contains Identity by applying the scaffolder to selectively add the source code provided in the Identity Razor Class Library (RCL).
